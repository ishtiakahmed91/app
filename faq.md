**How do I restore my subscription or lifetime purchase on a new device?**

To restore your subscription or lifetime purchase on a new device, ensure you are logged in with the same Apple ID that you used to make the original purchase. Open the app, go to the settings or paywall or lock section, and look for an option labeled "Restore Purchases" at the bottom of the screen. Tap this option to reinstate your subscription or lifetime purchase on the new device. If you encounter any issues, please contact our support team for assistance.

**Is my personal information safe with this app?**

We don’t collect any user information such as personal data(Email, phone number, address etc.) All activity information that you input into the app remains privately stored on your device. Data is directly synced with iCloud without any third party interactions. iCloud secures your information by encrypting it when it's in transit and storing it in iCloud in an encrypted format. Many Apple services use end-to-end encryption, which means that only you can access your information, and only on trusted devices where you're signed in with your Apple ID. More information about Apple/iCloud privacy and security can be found here [iCloud security overview](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202303#:~:text=Data%20security,in%20with%20your%20Apple%20ID.y) and [Apple Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/)

**Currently, the app only offers a lifetime purchase. What does that mean?**

The app provides only a lifetime purchase option, meaning you make a one-time payment for permanent access. There are no subscription renewals or additional fees—just pay once and use the app forever.

**How do I manage or cancel my subscription?**

To manage or cancel your subscription, open the Settings app on your iOS device, tap on your name at the top, then select "Subscriptions." Here, you'll see a list of your active subscriptions. Find the app in question, then tap on it to view options for managing or canceling your subscription. Note that canceling a subscription will prevent future charges, but you will still have access to the content until the end of the current billing cycle.

**What is the difference between a monthly/yearly subscription and a lifetime purchase?**

A subscription typically involves recurring payments (monthly or yearly) that provide access to premium features or content within the app. A lifetime purchase, on the other hand, is a one-time payment that grants permanent access to all premium features without the need for ongoing payments. Lifetime purchases can be a cost-effective option if you plan to use the app for an extended period.

**I can not decide the subscription plan. What is the best Pro subscription plan?**

The lifetime subscription offers exceptional value with a one-time payment for lifetime access, while the yearly subscription provides significantly more value compared to the monthly subscription.
       
**Does my subscription auto-renew?**

Yes. Your weekly/monthly/yearly subscription will renew automatically unless cancelled in due time.
        
**Can I get a refund?**

Both payment and refunds are managed by Apple; please reach out to Apple Support within 14 days for assistance with your purchase

**Are there any discounts available for students?**
